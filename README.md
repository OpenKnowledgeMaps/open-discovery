# open-discovery
This repository is intended to openly develop a roadmap for [Open Knowledge Maps](http://openknowledgemaps.org). Our goal is to revolutionize discovery with a visual interface that dramatically increases the visibility of research results for science and society alike. We are  building this interface to the world’s scientific knowledge as a public good.
